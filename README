			      LablGtkOSXApplication

The goal of this library is provide the OSXApplication object of
gtk-mac-integration[1] in Ocaml.

It has been done using
 - findlib 1.27
 - lablgtk2 2.14.2
 - gtk-osx-integration 1.0.1 (build by jhbuild)

The configure generation involves
 - ocaml-autoconf 1.1
 - pkg-config m4 files
 - autotools given by the bootstrap module of jhbuild
but the author did not take the time to learn how to use these tools so:
 - autoreconf does not work on its machine
 - the generated configure deals with --prefix --bindir --...dir whereas this is
 ocamlfind that will choose the "install" place.
Tell him is something is missing/should not be in the depository and/or if you
have clue to make a better configure.

While you've succeed to get a configure script, "./configure; make; open
example/example.app; make install" (probably, last command as super user) should
do the job.

You may have a look at src/gOSXApplication.mli and example/example.ml to learn how
to take advantage of the library that is the ocamlfind package "lablgtkosx" if
everything went well...
